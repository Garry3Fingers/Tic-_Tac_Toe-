# Tic_Tac_Toe
I need to build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

First of all, I need to somehow draw a board in the terminal. It'll the first class.
Then I need to create a base player class and two derived classes.
Board will be an array. Instances of Player class will send messages to Board Class.

I think, it'll be a different implementation at the end.
